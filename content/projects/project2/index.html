For us to answer this question we’ll try to find out which of the two has the best ratings!</p>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  rating by director
## t = 2.7144, df = 30.812, p-value = 0.01078
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Steven Spielberg and group Tim Burton is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.1596624 1.1256637
## sample estimates:
## mean in group Steven Spielberg       mean in group Tim Burton 
##                       7.573913                       6.931250</code></pre>

Our statistics analysis clearly shows that Spielberg wins against Burton.
I’m not going to lie, I actually agree with this. What do you guys think?</p>
